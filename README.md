#  Weather Forecast Website 
For this challenge, I made a weather forecast website. You can utilize the search box to get weather data from different cities in the world. 

## Sections

1. A search box to look for a city.

2. After submitting the city, you will be presented with the city's data and a five-day forecast. 

3. The city will show a UV number; if it is green, it means it is favorable; if it is yellow, it means it is moderate, and if it is red, it means it is dangerous. 

4. Once you submit a city, a list will form on the left, showing the list of all the cities that have been added.
